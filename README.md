Density Functional Theory with Finite Difference and Lagrange Function Basis Sets

Current features:
  * LDA approximation for exchange and correlation
  * non-periodic systems only
  * finite difference basis set
  * built in set of Pseudopotentials:
    * Ag, Al, Au, Be, B, Br, Cl, C, Cs, Cu, F, Ge, He, H, K, Li, Mg, Na, Ni, N, O, Pd, P, Rb, Si, S, Ti, V, W
